# VocabBot
VocabBot is a script that automatically completes vocabulary homework. It reads a Word document containing vocabulary terms, googles them, then writes their definitions to a new Word document using MLA formatting. 

## Usage
To use the script as is, you will need a Google Custom Search API Key and CSE ID, which you can get [here](https://cse.google.com/create/new). 

Once you have an API Key and CSE ID, just enter them into main.py and run the script.

## The Bot in Action
Here's some images of the script running on some of my shorter IB Economics vocabulary lists.
